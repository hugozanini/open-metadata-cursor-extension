# Active Context - Current Development State

## Current Work Focus
**Phase**: v1.0 Complete - Table-Level Lineage Visualization
**Branch**: `main` (feature merged successfully)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Core lineage functionality complete and battle-tested

## Recent Major Accomplishment
**üéâ LINEAGE VISUALIZATION v1.0 COMPLETED AND MERGED TO MAIN**

The lineage feature has been fully implemented, extensively debugged, and merged to main branch with comprehensive documentation. All critical issues have been resolved and the feature is production-ready for table-level lineage.

## Recent Changes (Latest Development Sessions)

### üèóÔ∏è Core Lineage Implementation ‚úÖ

#### 1. Complete Interactive Lineage System
**Achievement**: Built full-featured lineage visualization from scratch
**Implementation**:
- ReactFlow-based interactive graph visualization
- Custom LineageNode components with entity-specific styling
- ELK automatic layout engine for professional node positioning
- LineageModal full-screen overlay for complex graph exploration
- LineageService for fetching and processing OpenMetadata lineage data

**Files Created**:
- `src/services/LineageService.ts` - Lineage data fetching and processing
- `src/webview/components/Lineage/LineageViewer.tsx` - Main graph component
- `src/webview/components/Lineage/LineageModal.tsx` - Modal wrapper
- `src/webview/components/Lineage/LineageNode.tsx` - Custom node component
- `src/webview/components/Lineage/ExpandCollapseButtons.tsx` - Interactive controls
- `src/webview/components/Lineage/CustomEdge.tsx` - Styled graph edges
- `src/webview/components/Lineage/LineageUtils.ts` - Utility functions

### üîß Critical Bug Fixes & Logic Improvements ‚úÖ

#### 2. Expand/Collapse Logic Perfection
**Issues Fixed**: Multiple iterations to perfect the expand/collapse behavior
**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Directional Logic**: Right buttons ONLY expand downstream, left buttons ONLY expand upstream
- **Smart Collapse**: Collapsed nodes completely disappear from canvas (no floating disconnected nodes)
- **Logical Connections**: Downstream nodes cannot disconnect from upstream parents (empty circles instead of (-) buttons)
- **Proper State Management**: Tracks upstream/downstream hidden states independently
- **Recursive Node Hiding**: Collapsing a node hides entire subtrees in that direction

**Key Files Enhanced**:
- `src/webview/components/Lineage/LineageViewer.tsx` - State management and node filtering
- `src/webview/components/Lineage/ExpandCollapseButtons.tsx` - Button visibility logic
- `src/OpenMetadataExplorerProvider.ts` - Directional API calls

#### 3. Backend Directional Enforcement ‚úÖ
**Critical Fix**: Backend was ignoring direction parameters
**Solution**: 
- Added `getDirectionalLineage()` method to only fetch requested direction data
- Fixed `handleExpandLineage()` to respect upstream/downstream parameters
- Prevents wrong-direction nodes from appearing (e.g., right buttons opening upstream)

**File Enhanced**: `src/services/LineageService.ts`

## Current Feature Status (v1.0 COMPLETE)

### ‚úÖ Fully Working Features
1. **Extension Positioning**: Correctly loads in bottom panel next to terminal
2. **Search Interface**: Natural language and keyword search working
3. **OpenMetadata Integration**: API calls, authentication, data retrieval working
4. **AI Insights**: Gemini integration providing conversational responses
5. **Results Display**: Table cards with expandable details and AI analysis
6. **Interactive Lineage Visualization**: 
   - ReactFlow-based professional graph visualization
   - Expand/collapse functionality with (+) and (-) buttons
   - Directional expansion (left = upstream, right = downstream)
   - Smart collapse behavior (nodes disappear completely)
   - Logical connection rules (downstream nodes can't disconnect from parents)
   - Automatic layout with ELK algorithm
   - Full-screen modal interface
7. **Configuration**: Settings for API keys and URLs functional
8. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user feedback

## Immediate Context - PRODUCTION READY

### Current Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE v1.0
- ‚úÖ **All core functionality**: Search, AI, and table-level lineage working perfectly
- ‚úÖ **All critical bugs resolved**: Expand/collapse logic, directional expansion, node management
- ‚úÖ **Thoroughly tested**: Interactive expand/collapse with proper behavior
- ‚úÖ **Merged to main**: All improvements integrated and documented
- ‚úÖ **Professional quality**: Ready for demonstration and real-world use

### Configuration (Working)
Users need to set these VS Code settings:
```json
{
  "openmetadataExplorer.openmetadataUrl": "http://localhost:8585",
  "openmetadataExplorer.geminiApiKey": "your-api-key",
  "openmetadataExplorer.openmetadataAuthToken": "your-bot-token"
}
```

### Validated Working Flow ‚úÖ
1. User opens Extension Development Host (F5)
2. Extension loads in bottom panel  
3. Search works with natural language queries
4. AI insights stream in after search results
5. "View Lineage" buttons appear on table cards
6. Clicking lineage opens full-screen interactive graph
7. User can expand upstream (left +) and downstream (right +)
8. User can collapse connections (- buttons) which completely hides related nodes
9. Downstream nodes show empty circles (can't disconnect from parents)
10. All directional logic works correctly (right buttons only expand downstream)

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **ReactFlow over D3**: Easier integration, better VS Code theming
2. **ELK Layout**: Automatic graph positioning vs manual layout
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Fast search results + async AI insights
4. **Message Passing**: Clean separation between extension host and webview
5. **Null Safety**: Comprehensive checks for incomplete OpenMetadata data
6. **State-Based Node Management**: Tracks upstream/downstream hidden states independently
7. **Directional API Enforcement**: Backend respects direction parameters to prevent wrong data
8. **Complete Node Removal**: Collapsed connections remove entire subtrees from canvas

### UX Decisions Made  
1. **Bottom Panel Position**: Next to terminal where developers work
2. **Streaming AI Responses**: Similar to Cursor chat experience
3. **Interactive Lineage**: Full-screen modal for complex graph exploration
4. **Logical Button Behavior**: Right = downstream only, left = upstream only
5. **Smart Collapse**: Nodes disappear completely instead of floating disconnected
6. **Parent-Child Logic**: Downstream nodes can't disconnect from upstream parents
7. **Example Queries**: Mix of natural language and keyword examples

## Next Steps - v2.0 Development Phase

### üéØ HIGH PRIORITY: Column-Level Lineage
**Goal**: Show relationships between specific table columns
**Implementation Required**:
- Enhanced OpenMetadata API calls for column lineage
- Column-aware LineageNode components
- Column-to-column edge visualization
- Expandable column details within nodes

### üéØ HIGH PRIORITY: Observability Layer
**Goal**: Display data quality metrics, pipeline runs, monitoring information
**Implementation Required**:
- Integration with OpenMetadata profiler and data quality APIs
- Pipeline run status and history display
- Data quality metrics visualization on nodes/edges
- Real-time monitoring information

### üîß Performance & Polish
1. **Bundle Size**: Code splitting for ReactFlow components
2. **Caching**: Cache API responses for repeated queries  
3. **Large Graph Optimization**: Handle complex lineage graphs efficiently
4. **Search in Lineage**: Filter nodes within the graph
5. **Export Functionality**: Save lineage diagrams
